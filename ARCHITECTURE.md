# Gang Simulation Architecture

## Overview

This codebase implements a robust, production-ready gang faction simulation using a component-based entity system with event-driven architecture. The system is designed for scalability, performance, and maintainability.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Component-Based Entity System (ECS)
- **Entities**: Lightweight containers with unique IDs
- **Components**: Data and behavior modules (FactionComponent, GangMemberComponent, etc.)
- **Systems**: Game logic processors (GameManager, EntityManager)

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- Decoupled communication through EventBus
- Priority-based event processing
- Asynchronous operation support

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Object pooling for frequently created/destroyed entities
- Cached state for expensive calculations
- Frame budget management
- Batch processing capabilities

## Key Systems

### EntityManager
- Manages entity lifecycle (creation, destruction)
- Provides efficient entity queries
- Implements object pooling
- Automatic cleanup of destroyed entities

### EventBus
- Central communication hub
- Priority queue for events
- Event filtering and history
- Performance monitoring

### GameManager
- Main game loop
- Tick-based simulation
- Component update coordination
- Performance throttling

## Component Types

### Data Components
- **FactionComponent**: Faction resources, relationships, member lists
- **GangMemberComponent**: Member stats, state machine, order handling
- **TerritoryComponent**: Territory control, safety, businesses
- **BusinessComponent**: Income generation, damage, ownership
- **OrderComponent**: Order data, execution logic, success conditions

### Behavior Components
- **AIComponent**: Base AI decision-making framework
- **CommanderAIComponent**: Strategic faction AI

## Trait System

Reusable functionality through static trait classes:
- **Identifiable**: ID generation and validation
- **Poolable**: Object pooling interface
- **Validatable**: Data validation framework

## Memory Management

### Cleanup Systems
- Automatic entity destruction for dead members
- Order queue cleanup
- Event history limits
- Periodic garbage collection

### Object Pooling
- Reusable entity instances
- Reduced allocation overhead
- Configurable pool sizes

## Error Handling

### Logging System
- Severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Category-based filtering
- Performance tracking
- File output support

### Validation
- Component data validation
- Reference integrity checks
- Configuration validation

## Performance Features

### Caching
- AI state caching
- Expensive calculation results
- Configurable cache duration

### Throttling
- AI think time budgets
- Updates per frame limits
- Event processing caps

### Batch Processing
- Similar operations grouped
- Efficient data access patterns

## Configuration System

### GameConfig
- Centralized game parameters
- Save/load functionality
- Runtime validation
- Hot-reloading support

### Tunable Parameters
- Economy settings
- AI behavior
- Performance limits
- Game balance

## Event Flow Example

1. **Order Creation**
   ```
   Commander AI → Create Order Entity → EVENT: ORDER_CREATED
   ```

2. **Order Assignment**
   ```
   EVENT: ORDER_CREATED → Commander assigns to member → EVENT: ORDER_ASSIGNED
   ```

3. **Order Execution**
   ```
   Member processes order → State changes → EVENT: ORDER_COMPLETED
   ```

4. **Results**
   ```
   EVENT: ORDER_COMPLETED → Update faction resources → EVENT: FUNDS_CHANGED
   ```

## Best Practices

### Adding New Features
1. Create components for data/behavior
2. Use events for communication
3. Validate all data
4. Add logging for debugging
5. Consider performance impact

### Component Design
- Single responsibility
- Minimal dependencies
- Event-driven communication
- Proper cleanup in _on_detached()

### Performance Guidelines
- Cache expensive calculations
- Use object pooling for temporary entities
- Batch similar operations
- Monitor frame time budget
